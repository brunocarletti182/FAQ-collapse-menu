FAQ Window

**Descrição**
This is a simple FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) web page project. 
It provides information about common questions and answers using an accordion-style interface. 
Users can click on questions to reveal the answers. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
to create an interactive and user-friendly FAQ page.

Styling
The project is styled using CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. 
It uses a color scheme with light backgrounds and contrasting text. The FAQ items are presented as an accordion, 
which expands and collapses when clicked.

The layout is responsive, and it adapts for smaller screens (max-width: 768px) to provide a better user experience on mobile devices.

JavaScript Interaction
The JavaScript code (index.js) adds interactivity to the FAQ page. It enables users to click on questions to reveal their answers. 
When a question is clicked, the answer is displayed, and the open arrow icon is shown. 
Clicking on another question will close the previous one and open the new one, creating a smooth accordion effect.
